Also, the higher the athlete's level, the greater the chance of generating an exercise with an advanced stimulus.</p><p>The second field on the home page refers to the muscle groups the user wants to train.</p><p>After selecting the user level and groups, the workout will be generated.</p><p>At the top of the exercise list there is a unique code for the generated workout, this code can be copied and shared with another user so that they can view it.</p><p>With the workout code in hand, you can get back to it later by searching the home page.</p><p>All workouts have a view counter, the newly created ones are presented as &quot;Brand New&quot;.

Since the APIs used in the project have request limits, schedules were developed with <a href="#technologies-back">node-cron</a> so that every x minutes a request to these APIs is triggered. As soon as the back-end receives the responses from the APIs, their values are stored at the database, in this way, the front-end requests data directly from the server side.<p>    <p>Storing numerous cryptocurrency prices at short intervals of time generates a huge data load, which leads to delays when queries are executed at the database, especially taking into account the use of JOINS. To alleviate these problems, the following processes were carried out:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Indexes</strong> were added on certain columns, which greatly improved query response time</li>    <li><strong>Tables were partitioned</strong> by monthly intervals, which generated a great improvement in query response time</li>    <li><a href="#technologies-back">Redis</a> - to cache requests (this was the technique that most contributed to improving response time)</li></ul><p>However, to load the home page, an extremely costly and slow query is performed (although it is already optimized), which calculates data from approximately 200 cryptocurrencies. To solve this problem, I will rewrite the project in Next.js and I will apply an Infinite Scrolling to the main application table.</p><h3 id="external-apis">External APIs</h3><p>The following third party APIs were used to feed LuaCrypto's database:</p><ul>    <li><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/api">Coingecko</a> for cryptocurrencies data</li>    <li><a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/#api">Alternative.me</a> for fear and greed indexes</li>    <li><a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/">Alphavantage</a> for ETFs and Fiats data</li></ul><h3 id="technologies-back">Technologies</h3><p>The following technologies were used to build LuaCrypto's server:</p><ul>    <li><a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">Axios</a> to perform requests</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/coingecko-api">Coingecko API</a> to feed cryptocurrencies data into the local database</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">Cors</a> to block API requests from unwanted origins</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv">Dotenv</a> to set up environment variables</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express">Express</a> for routes management</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql">MySql</a> for database communication</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cron">Node-Cron</a> to schedule external API requests</li>    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis">Redis</a> to cache expensive queries results</li></ul><h2 id="database">Database</h2><p>LuaCrypto's database of choice was <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySql</a>.

        <h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>
        <p>This was an attempt to mimic Express router in PHP. The outcome went pretty well, resembling a lot the "Original" Express.</p>
        <p>The final product offers a router that accepts GET and POST requests.</p>
        <p>This project is actually kinda small, and wasn't tested a lot, so there is still a lot more room to improve.</p>
        <p>I'm aware that there is classes for managing requests and responses, but I wanted to build everything from scratch.</p>
        <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
        <p>This package offers a simple and standardized way to declare routes, accepting GET and POST parameters.</p>
        <h2 id="back-end">Back-end</h2>
        <p>The router is based on two main classes: Router and Response. Router receives and manages routes, Response is used to sent data back to the client.</p>
